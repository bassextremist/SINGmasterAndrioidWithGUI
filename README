This is current version of SING-master prototype for android. 
For more info about the idea of the project refer to:

-----------------------------------------
STATUS:
recording from mic works. pitch extraction works and is done realtime. 
tested under sdk 16 (4.1) with device emulator

-------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS: 

To have impression of real-time speed do "run" instead of "debug"


GUI  animation works but timing of color bars is not precise. it has not set priority: only runOnUiThread()
 audio recording thread has setThreadPriority(URGENT_AUDIO)

each pitch extraction buffer run in separate thread. 
TODO: put only 3 threads: 
1.st  record and put recorded chunks into a queue A
2.start pitch extraction  form queue A. !!!! Once all from queue is extracted, runOnGuiThread.enablePlayButton !!!!   
3. guiThread  

Pitch extraction works with AMDF alg from

(PitchDetector example here: https://github.com/srubin/TarsosDSP)
But is VEEEERY slow!
